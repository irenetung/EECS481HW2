Game Description
Connect Four is a two player game in which the objective is to connect four of your 'chips' such that they are all next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The two players take turns placing 'chips' The first player to do so wins the game. Traditionally, the game is played on a grid with slots along the top such that when a 'chip' is dropped in a column, it falls to the lowest available space. The application is set up so that player 1 and player 2 take turns going first. 

Pressing the menu button (under Hardware Buttons for the emulator) will allow you to start a new game or exit the game.
